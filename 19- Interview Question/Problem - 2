**Title**: Find the Number of Occurrences of an Element in a Sorted Array  

**Description**:  
You are given a sorted array of integers and a target element. Your task is to find and return the number of times the target element occurs in the array.  

**Input**:  
- A sorted array `arr` of integers (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).  
- An integer `target` representing the element to find in the array.  

**Output**:  
- An integer representing the count of occurrences of the target element in the array.  

**Constraints**:  
1. The array is sorted in ascending order.  
2. The array may contain duplicate elements.  
3. The size of the array is between 1 and 10^6.  

**Example**:  

1. **Input**:  
   `arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
   `target = 2`  
   **Output**:  
   `3`  

2. **Input**:  
   `arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`  
   `target = 1`  
   **Output**:  
   `5`  

3. **Input**:  
   `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7]`  
   `target = 2`  
   **Output**:  
   `0`  

**Note**:  
Optimize the solution to handle large arrays efficiently. Consider using binary search techniques instead of iterating through the entire array.
