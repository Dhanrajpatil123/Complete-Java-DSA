**Problem Statement:**  

You are given a sorted array in increasing order:  
`arr = [2, 2, 4, 4, 8, 12, 16]`  

Your task is to find the first occurrence of a given target value `target = 4` in the array. If the target exists in the array, print its index. If the target does not exist, print `-1`.  

**Example:**  
Input:  
`arr = [2, 2, 4, 4, 8, 12, 16]`  
`target = 4`  

Output:  
`Index = 2`  

**Constraints:**  
1. The array is sorted in increasing order.  
2. The array contains only integers.  
3. If the target value appears multiple times, return the index of its first occurrence.  
4. If the target value is not found, return `-1`.
